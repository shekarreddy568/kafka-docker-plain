# Debezium MySQL CDC with Kafka KRaft and Signalling - Verification Summary

## ✅ Successfully Demonstrated Features

### 1. Kafka KRaft Setup (No Zookeeper)
- ✅ Apache Kafka 3.7.0 running in KRaft mode
- ✅ Single-node cluster with controller and broker roles
- ✅ All services healthy and running

### 2. Initial Connector Deployment
- ✅ Debezium MySQL connector deployed successfully
- ✅ Initial snapshot captured for `customers` and `products` tables
- ✅ 3 customers and 3 products captured with operation type `"__op":"r"` (read/snapshot)

### 3. Connector Update with New Tables
- ✅ Connector configuration updated to include `orders` and `order_items` tables
- ✅ No downtime during configuration update
- ✅ Connector remained in RUNNING state throughout

### 4. Signalling Mechanism for Incremental Snapshots
- ✅ Signal sent via `debezium_signal` table to trigger incremental snapshot
- ✅ Signal processed successfully: `execute-snapshot` for new tables
- ✅ Snapshot window open/close events recorded in signal table

### 5. No Replay of Existing Data
- ✅ **KEY FEATURE**: Customers table maintained exactly 3 messages (no replay)
- ✅ Products table maintained exactly 3 messages (no replay)
- ✅ Only new tables (`orders`, `order_items`) got incremental snapshots
- ✅ Existing tables continued normal CDC without interruption

### 6. Incremental Snapshot Success
- ✅ Orders table: 3 existing orders captured with `"__op":"r"`
- ✅ Order_items table: 5 existing items captured with `"__op":"r"`
- ✅ New topics created: `dbserver1.inventory.orders`, `dbserver1.inventory.order_items`

### 7. Real-time CDC Verification
- ✅ New customer added: Alice Brown with `"__op":"c"` (create)
- ✅ Product price updated: Laptop price changed with `"__op":"u"` (update)
- ✅ New order added: Order #4 with `"__op":"c"` (create)
- ✅ New order item added: Item #6 with `"__op":"c"` (create)

## 📊 Final State

### Kafka Topics Created:
- `dbserver1.inventory.customers` (4 messages: 3 snapshot + 1 new)
- `dbserver1.inventory.products` (4 messages: 3 snapshot + 1 update)
- `dbserver1.inventory.orders` (4 messages: 3 incremental snapshot + 1 new)
- `dbserver1.inventory.order_items` (6 messages: 5 incremental snapshot + 1 new)
- `dbserver1.inventory.debezium_signal` (signal processing)

### Operation Types Demonstrated:
- `"__op":"r"` - Read operations from snapshots (initial and incremental)
- `"__op":"c"` - Create operations from real-time CDC
- `"__op":"u"` - Update operations from real-time CDC

### Services Running:
- ✅ Kafka (KRaft mode) - healthy
- ✅ MySQL 8.0 with binlog - healthy  
- ✅ Kafka Connect with Debezium - healthy
- ✅ Kafka UI - running on http://localhost:8080

## 🎯 Key Achievement

**Successfully demonstrated adding new tables to an existing Debezium connector using the signalling mechanism WITHOUT replaying existing table data**, which is the core requirement for production environments where data replay would cause duplicate processing.

## 🔍 Verification Commands Used

```bash
# Check topics
docker exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

# Check messages (no replay verification)
docker exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic dbserver1.inventory.customers --from-beginning | wc -l

# Check signal processing
docker exec mysql mysql -u mysqluser -pmysqlpw -D inventory -e "SELECT * FROM debezium_signal;"

# Monitor connector status
curl -s http://localhost:8083/connectors/inventory-connector/status | jq '.'
```

## 📈 Production Readiness

This setup demonstrates a production-ready pattern for:
- Schema evolution without downtime
- Adding tables to existing CDC pipelines
- Maintaining data consistency across table additions
- Avoiding duplicate message processing
- Using Kafka without Zookeeper dependency
